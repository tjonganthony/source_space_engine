                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="happy">Now, while you cadets were taking a break, I've been talking to the Crystal Order's engineers who built the Death Cube.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="happy">It seems that the service bots on the Death Cube are going to present a bit of a headache.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="thinking" audience="scottie">But aren't service bots harmless? They just maintain and repair the ship.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried" audience="pixel">Normally, that would be the case.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried" audience="pixel">However, in cases of high alert, like during space combat, the service bots will patrol the ship, and alert the security drones to any intrusions.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried" audience="pixel">Which complicates matters, since there are so many of them it's almost impossible to avoid them altogether.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="serious" audience="pixel">So, once on the Death Cube, you'll need to work together and systematically eliminate the service bots and security drones, before you make your way to the generator room.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="serious" audience="pixel">Which you will practice now using the simulator. So, let's get cracking!</SPEECH>
