                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">Now tell me class, has any of you ever seen snow? It’s a common weather phenomenon in terrestrial planets.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="excited">Oh, I have! But only in pictures or videos.</SPEECH>

            <NARRATION>Several human students raise their hands, but many of the aliens do not.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>Apparently, some of their home planets are gas giants, while others are able to withstand high amounts of heat, and have never heard of weather variation in their lives.</NARRATION>

                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">Well, a unit of snow – a snowflake – is what we’re going to be learning to create today.Efficiently, of course.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">The Koch snowflake is a fractal, named so because it looks exactly like a snowflake.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">It seems very complicated at a glance, but look closer.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">It’s made out of the same piece, just in different sizes and positions.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">In fact, it only takes me several waves of my hand to create another one, exactly like it.

            <NARRATION>He waves his hands as he speaks, and an identical snowflake appears beside the first one.</NARRATION>
            <DIALOGUE>
                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">So, this can be done very efficiently.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="normal">Now it’s your turn to do the same.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="unimpressed">It’s too complicated to do it that quickly! He must be cheating somehow...</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="you">I don't think so Pixel...</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">It's suspicious!</SPEECH>
