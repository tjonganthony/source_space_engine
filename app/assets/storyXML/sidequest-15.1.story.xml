                            <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried">Can you believe how outdated this thing is?! I can't believe how neglectful our technicians have been!</SPEECH>
                            <SPEECH speaker="you">Um, I'm not sure what you're talking about.</SPEECH>
                            <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried">Oh, sorry. It's the ship's weapons systems. We haven't had to use it since I took a pot shot at passing asteroid...</SPEECH>

                            <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried">It's a long story.</SPEECH>
                            <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried">Anyway, the system has not been maintained at all and is in an appaling condition. Some of these weapons modules are a relic from the past.</SPEECH>
                            <SPEECH speaker="scottie" expression="worried">And now wtih potential dangers looming ahead, the Grandmasters want the ship's weapons system brought up to speed, since there's a good chance we'll need to use them.</SPEECH>
