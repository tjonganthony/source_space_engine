            <NARRATION>As you and Pixel were busy upgrading the simulator, Navigator 'Grouch' walks in to check on your progress.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>After an unecessarily thorough inspection, he finally nodded with approval, albeit rather grudgingly.</NARRATION>
            <DIALOGUE>
                <SPEECH speaker="navigator" expression="bored">It's acceptable. For a couple of novices at least...</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="you" mode="thought">This guy...</SPEECH>
            </DIALOGUE>
            <NARRATION>Pixel scowled at him, evidently irritated by his aloofness.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>The navigator didn't seem to notice. He simply hands a set of instructions on a datapad over to you, before grunting a few instructions and leaving you to it.</NARRATION>

                <SPEECH speaker="navigator" expression="bored">Here.</SPEECH>
