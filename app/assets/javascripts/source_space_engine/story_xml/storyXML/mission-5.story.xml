                    <NARRATION>It was a message from Grandmaster Lok-Kim: "Greetings Cadets! Let's continue our lesson and move on to more exciting trainings! See you in the classroom in 5 minutes!"</NARRATION>

                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim">You will have to transform them into something you could possibly use.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim">Once you get good at this kind of thing, you won’t need to ever use your tablets to draw diagrams to illustrate a complicated Source concept.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="you" audience="lok-kim">Well, I don’t think I’d ever be teaching anyone anything to do with the Source...</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" audience="you">You’d never believe it, but some places have locks that can only be unlocked with these Source objects.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" audience="you">Only Sourcerers can unlock them, but of course you need to be more than just a good Sourcerer.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" audience="you">They’re usually encoded, so you need cryptographic training as well.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" audience="you">Back in the day, I encountered one of those doors…</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="unimpressed">Oh man... This must be one of his infamous long stories.</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="unimpressed">Lok-Kim is notorious for going off on a tangent in his classes.</SPEECH>

                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim">... and that was when I realized that it was all just a dream!</SPEECH>
                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="happy">It was fascinating!</SPEECH>

                        <SPEECH speaker="lok-kim" expression="worried">You’ve only got a few more minutes left to complete the rest!</SPEECH>

            <NARRATION>Unlike Earth-born yourself, she was born in a colony off-world, and seems much more knowledgeable than you about alien life.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>It looks like you’ve made your first friend at Source Academy.</NARRATION>
