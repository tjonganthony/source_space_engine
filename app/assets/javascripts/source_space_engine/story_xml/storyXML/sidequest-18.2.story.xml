            <NARRATION>After being put through the wringer by Scottie the whole afternoon, you retired to your room for a quick nap before training starts again.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>You were almost dozing off when there was an urgent knock on your door.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>Unwilling to get up, you continued sleeping.</NARRATION>
            <NARRATION>After a few more knocks, an impatient Pixel comes bursting into your room.</NARRATION>
            <DIALOGUE>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">Quick, get up!</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="you">Wha...? Go â€˜way, lemme sleep...</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">It's the simulator! I think we made some mistakes during the upgrade. It's not really generating those highly accurate simulations that we were expecting.</SPEECH>
           </DIALOGUE>
           <NARRATION>Your overworked and very sleepy brain struggles to process what Pixel was saying.</NARRATION>
           <DIALOGUE>
                <SPEECH speaker="you">Hmm? Wha- what's wrong with it?</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">Come on, I'll show you.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">We really need to fix it before Navigator 'Grouch' finds out about it. His smugness would be intolerable.</SPEECH>
           </DIALOGUE>
           <NARRATION>Reluctantly, you get out of bed and followed her to the classroom.</NARRATION>

                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">Yeah, no shit. Any ideas why it might've turned out like this?</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="you">Well, it's obvious.</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="serious">What do you mean it's obvious?</SPEECH>
                <SPEECH speaker="you">You've Pixel-ated them!</SPEECH>

                <SPEECH speaker="pixel" expression="unimpressed">I'm going to try and fix this before anyone finds out.</SPEECH>
